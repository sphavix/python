# Deploy a linear regression model with SQL machine learning

The repository contains the following content/steps to predict the number of rentals that you'll have on a future date:
    
   
    Import a sample database
    
    Load the data from the database into a pandas data frame
    
    Prepare the data in Python by removing some columns
    
    Train a linear regression model
    
    Make predictions using the linear regression model
    
    Create a stored procedure that generates the machine learning model
    
    Store the model in a database table
    
    Create a stored procedure that makes predictions using the model
    
    Execute the model with new data
